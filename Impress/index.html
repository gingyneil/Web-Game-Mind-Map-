                    people must have seen that plane crash, you'll get rescued soon.
                     Well now you really need some food but you should start building a raft to

                    You choose swim to the island NICE! youre not afraid of sharks after all.
                     In fact cows cause more deaths then shark attacks each year. 
                     But you cant escape these sharks, they eat you and you DIE

                     You try shaking it and DIE. A coconut lands on
                     your heads with a crushing blow. Did you know coconuts are responsible

                     on the neighboring island and find help. CONGRATS
